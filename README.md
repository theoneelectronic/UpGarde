Python program that pings an host, gets the HTPP status code, retrieve the header and stores it in a JSON formatted dictionary. The dictionary is to be saved in a MongoDB database.

Disclaimer: all the code is in a test/work in progress early stage -> pre-alpha. The code works properly though so, should you want to ping and retrieve the headers of a website you're welcome to use it.
